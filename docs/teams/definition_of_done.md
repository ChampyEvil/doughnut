# Definition of Done

## Source Quality

- Changes are committed to the `main` or `trunk` branch of the mono-repo.
- The code, tests, and documentation are free of lint errors.
- All code changes are reviewed by at least one other developer
  - Code from pair/mob programming is considered reviewed.
- English is used for all code, tests, and documentation.

## Modular Integrity

- Compiler and runtime warnings are treated as errors.
- All code is fully unit tested.
- Code quality is maintained through the resolution or justification of all code smells, by:
  - Eliminating duplicate code.
  - Reducing code elements to the minimum required for intended functionality.
  - Using domain language to clearly convey intent.
  - Removing all unused code, regardless of test coverage.
  - Adding comments for clarity where needed.

## System Integration

- No known defects; all bugs fixed with highest priority
- Automated end-to-end tested with all internal services integrated
- Exploratory testing is performed to ensure the system is usable and reliable.
- All external dependencies are current and verified against the latest stable versions.
- The CI system successfully processes all changes.
- CI system builds are completed in 10 minutes or less.

## Deployment and User Experience

- Production deployment is automatic upon each successful CI build.
- Deployments occur with zero downtime.
- User data integrity and security are assured at all times.
- The user manual is kept up-to-date, and users are informed of changes.
- Product Owner approval is obtained but does not hinder deployment.
