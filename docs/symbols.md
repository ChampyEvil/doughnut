# How to Pronounce Basic Programming Symbols

## Introduction

Sawadika! Welcome to my dad's training workshop. To make sure you adult people can communicate better, I will teach you how to pronounce the basic programming symbols. This is super helpful for clear communication when you're pair programming or discussing code with others. Let's get started!

## Pronunciation of Symbols

1. **Dot (`.`)**
   - It can also be called a period, but in programming, it's usually called a dot.

2. **Comma (`,`)**

3. **Colon (`:`)**

4. **Semicolon (`;`)**

5. **Parentheses (`(` `)`)**
   - It can also be called round brackets, or just brackets.
   - The left one is an opening parenthesis, and the right one is a closing parenthesis.

6. **Brackets (`[` `]`)**
   - To avoid confusion, these are also called square brackets.
   - Open square bracket and close square bracket.

7. **Braces / Curly Braces (`{` `}`)**
   - These are braces or curly braces.
   - Just don't call them the "mmmmmmm brackets"

8. **Angle Brackets (`<` `>`)**
   - The are also called less than and greater than symbols.
   - But as brackets, they are open angle bracket and close angle bracket.

9. **Slash (`/`)**

10. **Backslash (`\`)**

11. **Asterisk (`*`)**
    - Can also be called a star or multiplication sign.
    - "3 * 4" is pronounced as "3 times 4".

12. **Ampersand (`&`)**
    - This is an ampersand.
    - For "a & b" you can say "a and b". If your driver doesn't understand, you may clarify by "a ampersand b."
    - The bottom line is, don't get angry. Just communicate clearly.

13. **Double Ampersand (`&&`)**
    - "&&" is pronounced as "and and". It's used in logical AND operations: `a && b`. "a and and b".

14. **Pipe (`|`)**

15. **Caret (`^`)**

16. **Tilde (`~`)**

17. **Exclamation Mark (`!`)**
    - It's also called a bang!

18. **Equal Sign (`=`)**
    - In the case of "a = 3", you can say "a equals 3", or "a is 3". If they don't understand you, you can explain that it's "a equals sign 3".
    - Again, just don't get angry.

19. **Plus Sign (`+`)**

20. **Minus Sign (`-`)**

21. **Fat Arrow / Rocket (`=>`)**
    - I think my dad will prefer "rocket" over "fat arrow".

22. **Arrow (`->`)**

23. **Triple Equals / Strict Equals (===)**

## Conclusion

That's it for today's video! I hope this helps you pronounce programming symbols more confidently. Please be kind to your colleague when pair programming. Let's all use the same language and we all can be good friends. Remember, the bottom line is to be patient and not get angry if people don't understand you. Sawadika! üôè
