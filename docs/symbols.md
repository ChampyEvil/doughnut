# How to Pronounce Basic Programming Symbols

## Introduction

Sawadika! Welcome to my dad's training workshop. To make sure you adult people can communicate and my dad can return home safely, I will teach you how to pronounce the basic programming symbols. Let's get started!

## Pronunciation of Symbols

1. **Dot (`.`)**
   - It can also be called a period, but in programming, it's usually called a dot.

2. **Comma (`,`)**

3. **Colon (`:`)**

4. **Semicolon (`;`)**

5. **Parentheses (`(` `)`)**
   - It can also be called round brackets, or just brackets.
   - The left one is an open parenthesis, and the right one is a close parenthesis.

6. **Brackets (`[` `]`)**
   - To avoid confusion, these are also called square brackets.
   - Open square bracket and close square bracket.

7. **Braces / Curly Braces (`{` `}`)**
   - These are braces or curly braces.
   - Just don't call them the "mmmmmmm brackets"

8. **Angle Brackets (`<` `>`)**
   - They are also called less than and greater than symbols.
   - But as brackets, they are open angle bracket and close angle bracket.

9. **Slash (`/`)**

10. **Backslash (`\`)**

11. **Asterisk (`*`)**
    - Can also be called a star or multiplication sign.
    - "3 * 4" is pronounced as "3 times 4".

12. **Ampersand (`&`)**
    - This is an ampersand.
    - For "a & b" you can say "a and b". If my dad looks confused, you may clarify by "a ampersand b."
    - The bottom line is, don't get angry. Just communicate clearly.

13. **Double Ampersand (`&&`)**
    - It can also be pronounced as "and and".

14. **Pipe (`|`)**
    - And "||" is "pipe pipe", or "double pipe".

15. **Caret (`^`)**

16. **Tilde (`~`)**

17. **Exclamation Mark (`!`)**
    - It's also called a bang!

18. **Equal Sign (`=`)**
    - In the case of "a = 3", you can say "a equals 3", or "a is 3". If they don't understand you, you can explain that it's "a equal sign 3".
    - Again, just don't get angry.

19. **Plus Sign (`+`)**

20. **Minus Sign (`-`)**

21. **Fat Arrow / Rocket (`=>`)**
    - I think my dad will prefer "rocket" over "fat arrow".

22. **Arrow (`->`)**

23. **Triple Equals / Strict Equals (===)**

24. **Single Quote (`'`)**

25. **Double Quote (`"`)**

26. **Backtick (`` ` ``)**

27. **At Sign, Hash, Dollar, Percentage (`@`, `#`, `$`, `%`)**

## Conclusion

That's it for today's video! I hope this helps you pronounce programming symbols more confidently. Please be kind to my dad when he is pair programming with you. Let's all use the same language and we all can be good friends. Remember, the bottom line is to be patient and not get angry if people don't understand you. Sawadika! üôè
