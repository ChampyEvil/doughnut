# Manual Testing

Please follow the instructions in the README to start the frontend and backend servers.
To use the AI services, you will need to start th backend service with the 
environment variable `OPENAI_API_TOKEN` set.

Visit http://localhost:5173/ to see the frontend web-app. The backend API is available at http://localhost:9081, and you will see the built frontend web-app there as well, but it wil not auto-reload on changes. So stay with the 5173 port.
