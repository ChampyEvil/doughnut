        Then I should see these notes belonging to the user at the top level of all my notes
            | note-title                               | note-description          |

            | title                | testingLinkTo |
            | Shape                |               |
            | Rectangle            | Shape         |
            | Square               | Rectangle     |
            | Triangle             | Shape         |
            | Equilateral triangle | Triangle      |
            | Circle               | Shape         |
        When I open "Shape" note from top level
        Then I should see there are 5 descendants
