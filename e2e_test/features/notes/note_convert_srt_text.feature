Feature: Convert SRT format to Text
  As a learner, I want to convert the SRT format to text in the Note details.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an existing user
    And there are some notes for the current user:
      | topicConstructor | details             |
      | SRT format   | 1 00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:15,300 This is an example of a subtitle. |
  
  Scenario: Convert srt format to text
    Given I have note with SRT format
    When I convert it to text format
    Then I get note with text "This is an example of a subtitle."

  Scenario: Convert srt with wrong format to text
    Given I have note with wrong SRT format
    When I convert it to text format
    Then I get error warning that file is not convertible

  Scenario: Convert srt with text format
    Given I have note with text format
    When I convert it to text format
    Then I get the notification that note is already text format

  Scenario: convert button is dsiplay

      | topicConstructor                        | details                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
      | Potentially shippable product increment | The output of every Sprint is called a Potentially Shippable Product Increment. The work of all the teams must be integrated before the end of every Sprintâ€”the integration must be done during the Sprint. |
