Feature: Repetition Quiz
  As a learner, I want to use quizzes in my repetition to help and gamify my learning.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an existing user
    And there are some notes for the current user:
      | Topic            | details                        | skipReview | Parent Topic|
      | English          |                                | true       |             |
      | sedition         | Sedition means incite violence | false      | English     |
      | sedation         | Put to sleep is sedation       | false      | English     |
      | medical          |                                | true       | English     |

  Scenario: View last result when the quiz answer was correct
    Given I learned one note "sedition" on day 1
    And I learned one note "sedation" on day 1
    When I am repeat-reviewing my old note on day 2
    And I choose answer "sedition"
    Then I should see that my last answer is correct
    And I should see the review point info of note "sedition"
